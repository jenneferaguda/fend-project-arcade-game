## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Download

Download the zip copy of the arcade game and decompress the file on your computer. Open the index.html file on any internet brower then you can start playing.

## Play

In this game you have a Player and five(5) Enemies (bugs).

**To play the game:** use UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the player. Your goal is to reach the water at the top of the game board without colliding into any one of the enemies. If the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting position. Once the player reaches the water, the game is won and then the player moves back to its original position and you can play again.
